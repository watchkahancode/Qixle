# Qixle
Qixle is a minimal and personal e-commerce application built using Flutter, Node/Express.js and MongoDB. This project demonstrates my foundational skills in bridging Flutter front-ends and Node.js servers along with my robust state management skills in client-side using BLoC and handling REST APIs using JSON format in server-side code.
